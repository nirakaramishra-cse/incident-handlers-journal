# Incident Handler’s Journal – SOC Investigation & Analysis

This project documents a series of incident investigations recorded in an
Incident Handler’s Journal. It demonstrates how security alerts and suspicious
activities are analyzed, documented, and mapped to the incident response
lifecycle using real-world tools and methodologies.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical **SOC analyst thinking**,
incident documentation skills, and structured response analysis rather than
just tool usage.

---

## Project Overview

An Incident Handler’s Journal is used by security analysts to record observations,
decisions, tools used, and lessons learned while responding to security events.
In this project, multiple incident scenarios are analyzed and documented to
simulate real SOC investigation workflows.

This repository converts a learning journal into a professional, portfolio-ready
incident response project.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- How security incidents are **detected, analyzed, and documented**
- Use of investigative tools to analyze network traffic and suspicious files
- Application of the **Incident Response Lifecycle**
- Clear written communication of security findings
- Analytical thinking used in Security Operations Center (SOC) environments

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Wireshark
- tcpdump
- VirusTotal
- Network traffic analysis techniques
- Incident response documentation practices

## Incident Handler’s Journal

The `incident_journal.md` file contains documented incident entries, each
recorded using a structured approach that includes:

- Description of the event
- Detection method
- Tools used during investigation
- Key observations
- Actions taken or recommended
- Lessons learned

Each entry represents a realistic incident-handling scenario.

---

## Incident Response Analysis

The `incident_response_summary.md` file consolidates insights from all journal
entries and maps them to standard incident response phases, including:

- Detection and Analysis
- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery
- Post-Incident Improvements

This section focuses on improving security posture based on observed incidents.

---

## Why This Project Matters

Many entry-level portfolios focus only on tools or commands. This project focuses
on **how an analyst thinks and responds during incidents**, which is a core
expectation for SOC and Blue Team roles.

It highlights investigative reasoning, documentation quality, and security
decision-making — skills that are critical in real operational environments.
